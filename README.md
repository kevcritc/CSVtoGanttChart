# CSVtoGanttChart
Creates a Gantt chart from a csv file see the excel spreadsheet (see example).  I will add more feature in future versions.
The plot is saved in same directory as the code as default. Tasks with time gaps' can be added (five suggested in the example, but in practive it is not limited).
 Milestones and deliverables can be added. Output .xlsx files summerise the milestones and deliverables with labels in chronological order matching the plot. Finish start dependencies can be added to link tasks using the Task ID column.
